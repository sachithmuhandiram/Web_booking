# Web_booking

Here I am trying to implement a simple web application for booking. 
Users are divided into two, regular and admins. Admins can add items and regular users can only book those items.

For development I will use Docker file and go alpine image as the base image.

Frontend side I will use basic html and MySQL will be default database.

I will try my best to use go testing tools to test the project.

#### Tasks

- [x] Dockerfile for the project
- [x] alpine go as base image
- [ ] Go - MySQL integration
- [ ] Simple login page
- [ ] User previledges
- [ ] Admin protal
- [ ] Go test modules
